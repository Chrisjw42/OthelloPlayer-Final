To Play:

Simply run Othello.py in the command line. Instructions should be straight forward. Your python environemnt will need Tensorflow. 

You can change the depth of the tree search. The higher the depth is, the tougher the AI gets. Beware, high depth can significantly slow down the AI. A depth of 1 means that it will only plan one move ahead, and is very short-sighted. 

To change the depth, go to line 15 of Othello.py, and change the value maxSearchDepth. 

The data:

The initial dataset that was web-scraped was simply not enough. Credit to Argens Ng for helping out with bit-level decoding of the larger set of Othello games. 

Other stuff:

The CNN is built across a series of jupyter notebooks, feel free to peruse.
